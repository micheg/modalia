# Modalia

**Modalia** is a lightweight React library that leverages the native HTML `<dialog>` tag to create flexible and accessible modals. By using React Portals, Modalia ensures that the modal is directly attached to the `body` element of the DOM, allowing for clean integration without affecting the rest of the component tree. The library enforces that only one modal can be active at a time, providing a focused and streamlined user experience. 

---

**Modalia** provides a simple API with a few key parameters for customization. The `isOpen` prop controls the visibility of the modal, while the `onClose` function is triggered when the user closes the modal (such as by clicking the close button). The `title` prop allows you to set a title for the modal, and the `size` prop can be used to adjust the modalâ€™s dimensions, with options like `small`, `medium`, `large`, and `xl`. The modal content is passed as `children`, making it easy to customize what appears inside the dialog. Modalia ensures that only one modal can be active at a time, and the component uses React Portals to attach the modal directly to the DOM, ensuring proper stacking and isolation from the rest of your app's layout.
